# BFS
# O(N) Visiting each node exactly once
# O(N) Space is occupied by the visited

# Deep copy is a process in which the copying process occurs recursively.
# It means first constructing a new collection object and then recursively populating
# it with copies of the child objects found in the original. In case of deep copy,
# a copy of object is copied in other object.
# It means that any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object.

# A shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and then populating it
# with references to the child objects found in the original.
# The copying process does not recurse and therefore wonâ€™t create copies of the child
# objects themselves. In case of shallow copy, a reference of object is copied in other object.
# It means that any changes made to a copy of object do reflect in the original object.
