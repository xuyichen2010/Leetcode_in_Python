# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-in-a-graph/

# Depth First Traversal can be used to detect a cycle in a Graph.
# DFS for a connected graph produces a tree.
# There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph.
# A back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (self-loop) or one of its ancestor
# in the tree produced by DFS.

# If we reach a vertex that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree.
